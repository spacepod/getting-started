getting-started
===============

The repository contains examples of how to integrate with Google Genomics API. The code within each language-specific folder demonstrates the same things:
* Getting the read bases for NA12872 at specific a position
* Getting the variant overlapping that same position, and outputting the genotype

All languages will require a valid Client ID and Client secret. Follow the first step on https://developers.google.com/genomics/ to set up credentials for a "Client ID for native application".

Copy the "client ID" and "client secret" values from that new credential, and follow your favorite language-specific README to run some code.
